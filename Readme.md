# ITensorEntropyTools.jl
---

A set of tools designed to compute entanglement entropy of a MPS.

## Credits
This library was written by Ryan Levy, with heavy inspiration from prior work with Abid Khan (@abid1214) with helpful conversations with Bryan K Clark and Edgar Solomonik.

## TODO

- Matrix Free density matrix tools
- Remove dependence on tags
- combine site and link codes? 
- Generalized to ITensorNetworks
